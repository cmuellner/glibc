/*
 * Here are the ordering rules of extension naming defined by RISC-V
 * specification :
 * 1. All extensions should be separated from other multi-letter extensions
 *    by an underscore.
 * 2. The first letter following the 'Z' conventionally indicates the most
 *    closely related alphabetical extension category, IMAFDQLCBKJTPVH.
 *    If multiple 'Z' extensions are named, they should be ordered first
 *    by category, then alphabetically within a category.
 * 3. Standard supervisor-level extensions (starts with 'S') should be
 *    listed after standard unprivileged extensions.  If multiple
 *    supervisor-level extensions are listed, they should be ordered
 *    alphabetically.
 * 4. Non-standard extensions (starts with 'X') must be listed after all
 *    standard extensions. They must be separated from other multi-letter
 *    extensions by an underscore.
